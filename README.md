# Overview:
A website showing the different kinds of EJS tags. 
Start with a title displayed in an h1 rendered from the server, a paragraph element showing the current number of seconds. If the current number of seconds on the clock is even, then the website will display the items from the server, but if it's odd, it will show no items.
The copyright comes from the footer.ejs file.

The user can check it by refreshing the website.
